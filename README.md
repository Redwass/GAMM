# Graph Agil Multidimensionnal Model (GAMM)

The GAMM is a flexible approach to schema and data evolution in data warehouses. The model allows designers to integrate new data sources and accommodate new user requirements to enrich the analytical capabilities of the data warehouse. It is an approach based on a multi-version scalable schema model and a data warehouse stored in a unique global graph database. Each schema version (SV) is valid for a period of time (T) characterised by a Starting_Time (ST) and an Ending_Time (ET), and it corresponds to a data instance (DInst) extracted from the graph-based data warehouse. 

According to the GAMM approach, we have generated 3 chronological versions using the SSB data as shown below. As a reminder, the Star Schema Benchmark, or SSB, was designed to evaluate the performance of database systems for star schema data warehouse queries. The SSB schema is based on the [TPC-H benchmark] (http://www.tpc.org/tpch/), but in a modified form with LINEORDER as a central fact table and dimension tables for customer, part, supplier, and date. The queries are also based on the TPC-H queries, but the number of queries is reduced to 13 and have been chosen to cover as much of the SSB as possible, so that potential users can derive a performance evaluation of the weighted subset they expect to use in practice. They are divided into 4 subgroups according to the difficulty and the number of domensions involved. The idea is that the total number of fact table rows retrieved will be determined by the selectivity (i.e., total Filter Factor FF) of restrictions on dimensions.

As the SSB data spans from 1992 to 1998, the versioning was set as follows :

(1) A 1st schema for 1992 and 1993 data composed of a fact Sales analyzed according to the Part and Customer dimensions. The fact Sales is indicated by the measures Sales_Amount, Discount and Supplycost. The dimension Part is described by the attributes P_Name and Size and a hierarchical levels Category, Mfgr, Brand and Type. The dimension Customer is described by the attributes C_Name, C_Address and C_Phone, and a hierarchical levels C_City, C_Nation, C_Region and Segment. Note that for further study, we ourselves created these levels that were attributes in the SSB original dataset. This version is valid during the period ùëá1 =[01/01/2019,31/12/2019] 

(2) A 2nd schema version for data from 1994 to 1996 characterised by he addition of a new Supplier dimension described by the attributes S_Name, S_Address and S_Phone, and a hierarchical levels S_City, S_Nation and S_Region. This version is valid during the periodùëá2 =[01/01/2020,31/12/2020]

(3) A 3rd version of the schema for 1997 and 1998 data characterised by the removal of the Customer dimension and the addition of a Quantity measure. This version is valid during the period ùëá3 = [01/01/2021,31/12/2021

the same ssb schema using the graph approach called Graph Star Schema Benchmark as shown in the figure below. The 13 SSB queries were built using Cypher Language Request (CLR) specific to the Neo4j graph database.

We have established two case studies based on the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB), a 1st study for the functional validation of our approach and a 2nd study for the time performance tests for graph DW.\\
As part of the functional validation study, we chose to perform the instantiation process on Neo4j for several  in \textisc(Figure \ref{fig_ssb_version}); then direct and cross queries were performed on it.\\ 


## 1. Platform, data and installation. 

To install the GSSB, use the graph database Neo4j version 4.x.x or higher. The data to be downloaded from [Download](https://github.com/Redwass/GSSB/tree/main/gssb_data) is in the CSV's files. The configuration and installation commands on Windows and Linux platforms are as follows:

### 1.1 Neo4j configuration

This configuration is for 16,0 Go of RAM

#### Java Heap Size: 

dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=4096m

dbms.memory.heap.max_size=4096m

dbms.memory.pagecache.size=9216m

### 1.2 Create data for database

#### For windows 
```cmd
neo4j-admin.bat import --database=gssb --nodes=lineorder=C:\gssb_data\lineorder-header.csv,C:\gssb_data\lineorder.csv --nodes=part=C:\gssb_data\part-header.csv,C:\gssb_data\part.csv --relationships=order_part=C:\gssb_data\order_part-header.csv,C:\gssb_data\order_part.csv
```

#### For Linux 
```cmd
neo4j-admin import --database=gssb --nodes=lineorder=C:\gssb_data\lineorder-header.csv,C:\gssb_data\lineorder.csv --nodes=part=C:\gssb_data\part-header.csv,C:\gssb_data\part.csv --relationships=order_part=C:\gssb_data\order_part-header.csv,C:\gssb_data\order_part.csv
```

### 1.3 Create database
After the database is set up using the neo4j-admin command, it must be created manually on :

#### Command line
CREATE DATABASE gssb (on system database)

#### Neo4j desktop 
on the <<+Create database>> tab with the name gssb.

### 1.4 Create indexes
This is not required, but you can create the following indexes to optimise query execution :

create index index_part_category for (p:part) on (p.P_CATEGORY);

create index index_part_brand for (p:part) on (p.P_BRAND1);

create index idxex_customer_region for (c:customer) on (c.C_REGION);

create index idxex_customer_nation for (c:customer) on (c.C_NATION);

create index idxex_customer_city for (c:customer) on (c.C_CITY);
